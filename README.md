Moms Who Blog is an improvement to Mom Blog.

It is a work in progress to hopefully be released to the public in a few months.

For this project I used a MERN Stack with a separate backend. It also incorporates React-router and a few hover effects.

This projects was especially hard on me because it tested my understanding of how classes and everything connect, as well as my abilities to make every piece of code work. I doubted myself a lot during this project because the crazy struggles and errors made me feel like I was incapable of doing anything. As Rachel (on of my classmates) put it, I felt like I was trash!.

I encountered so many errors starting this project and some didn't even make sense. The whole backend would crash over a typo I couldn't find, or the front end didn't connect to the back end correctly. So many different things... And in trying to make things work I refactored so many things in the code that it just confused me more.

I was super upset that I couldn't accomplish the authentication. Since this is an improvement to the original, it is not good enough if it's not authenticated, but hopefully it'll get there soon enough.

I can't say that I am proud of this project but I am proud of what I've been able to accomplish when comparing my first project with this one and how far I've come.

An improvement would most definitely be to add authentication and fixed the wacky css. At some point I hope to make it so that moms can connect with each other, like become friends on the app, and maybe even chat.
